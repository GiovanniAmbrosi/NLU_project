# About
This is the final repository for the project delivery of the Natural Language Understanding course at the University of Trento.

# Language Model
The project focuses on the implementation of a Language Model framework using the Penn Tree Bank Dataset. </br>
The objective is to implement a Neural Network (in this case a LSTM) to predict the next word given a sequence of previous words and to regularize the model in order to obtain the best possible result. The baseline is set to 90.7 Perplexity score.
